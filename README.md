This is a Flutter quiz app developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The app presents a series of questions to the user, who can answer them with either "Yes" or "No." It tracks the user's answers, marks them as correct or wrong, and provides a popup to ask if the user wants to play again.

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions with two answer options: "Yes" or "No"
